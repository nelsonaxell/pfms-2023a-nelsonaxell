//    TASK 2
//    The `Rectangle` class already has a special member function.
//    Thanks to *Polymorphism* we can have functions with same name but different number of parameters.
//    Can you add to the `Rectangle` class another function that enables the `Rectangle` to on creation have `width` , `height` and `description` initialised with values supplied by user of the class.
//    You will need to add the declaration of this member function in the [header of Rectangle class](./a2/rectangle.h) as
//    well as implement this function in [implementation file of Rectangle class](./a2/rectangle.cpp).

    // This is a example of why you should not allow direct access to member variables (why they are private)
    // Given we have a function to set the member varaibles, we also can leverage this function to set any
    // other member variables required, of perform any other operations that are needed to be executed
    // (such as invoking other methods)
